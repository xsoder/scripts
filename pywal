# Reload polybar, dmenu, alacritty, neofetch, starship colors after pywal

# Reload Polybar (change your bar name if needed)
polybar-msg cmd restart >/dev/null 2>&1

# Reload Xresources for dmenu if you use it (or recompile dmenu with new colors)
xrdb ~/.Xresources

# Reload Alacritty config (alacritty reads config on start)
# You can restart Alacritty or send SIGUSR1 if your setup supports live reload
# Here we'll just restart all running Alacritty terminals:
pkill -USR1 alacritty

# Reload Neofetch config/colors by forcing it to redraw
# For terminal neofetch, just clear and run it manually
# Or you can create an alias/script that calls neofetch to refresh colors

# Reload starship prompt (it reads config on new shell launch)
# You can reload starship in running terminals by sourcing its config or restarting shells
# For safety, here we just print a message to restart terminal for colors to update
echo "Restart your terminal to see updated starship prompt colors."

# You can add any other commands to reload programs here
